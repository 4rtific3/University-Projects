				<p>Naples: A City of Culture, History and Pizza</p>
			</div>
			<p>Naples is the regional capital of Campania and the third-largest city of Italy, after Rome and Milan. Founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC, Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples' historic city centre is the largest of its kind in Europe and has been designated as a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/726/">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the <a href="https://visitworldheritage.com/en/eu/caserta-royal-palace-and-park-italy/73cf1988-9d13-4658-99f5-2f23a706bc00">Palace of Caserta</a> and the Roman ruins of <a href="https://www.visitpompeiivesuvius.com/en/pompeii">Pompeii</a> and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius. Neapolitan cuisine is noted for its association with pizza, which originated in the city, as well as numerous other local dishes. Restaurants in the Naples' area have earned the most stars from the Michelin Guide of any Italian province.</p>

				<p>Santa Chiara is a religious complex in Naples, Italy, that includes the Church of Santa Chiara, a monastery, tombs and an archeological museum. The Basilica church of Santa Chiara faces Via Benedetto Croce, which is the easternmost leg of Via Spaccanapoli. The church facade of Santa Chiara is diagonally across from the church of Gesù Nuovo.</p>
			  	<p>Officially known as the Complesso Monumentale di Santa Chiara (the monumental complex of Santa Chiara), the beautiful monastery has a basilica and a small museum with a religious library. However, Santa Chiara is most famous for its elaborately decorated cloisters.</p>
				<p>The Santa Chiara cloisters are made up of 72 octagonal columns covered in hand-painted Majorca tiles with benches connecting each of the pillars. Every single tile is unique, and the combined effect is mesmerizing.&nbsp;</p>

		  	  <figure class="floatleft"><img src="images/pompeii & vesuvius.png" width="100%" alt=""/><figcaption>Pompeii Ruins & Mt Vesuvius</figcaption></figure>
		  	  <p>Pompeii was an ancient city located in what is now the comune of Pompei near Naples in the Campania region of Italy. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area (e.g. at Boscoreale, Stabiae), was buried under 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.</p>
		  	  <p>The ghostly ruins of ancient Pompeii  make for one of the world's most engrossing archaeological experiences. Much of the site's value lies in the fact that the town wasn't simply blown away by Vesuvius  but buried under a layer of lapilli . The result is a remarkably well-preserved slice of ancient life, where visitors can walk down Roman streets and snoop around millennia-old houses, temples, shops, cafes, amphitheatres and even a brothel.&nbsp;</p>
			  	<p>Grand public buildings included an impressive forum and an amphitheatre; lavish villas and all kinds of houses, dating back to the 4th century BCE, were also uncovered. Inside were some preserved remains of people sheltering from the eruption; others lay buried as they fled; bakeries were found with loaves still in the ovens.&nbsp;</p>

			  <figure class="floatright"><img src="images/cappella sansevero.jpg" width="100%" alt=""/><figcaption>Cappella Sansevero Chapel</figcaption></figure>
			  <p>It's in this Masonic-inspired baroque chapel that you'll find Giuseppe Sanmartino's incredible sculpture, Cristo velato (Veiled Christ), its marble veil so realistic that it's tempting to try to lift it and view Christ underneath. It's one of several artistic wonders that include Francesco Queirolo's sculpture Disinganno (Disillusion), Antonio Corradini's Pudicizia (Modesty) and riotously colourful frescoes by Francesco Maria Russo that have remained untouched since their creation in 1749.</p>
			  <p>The chapel received its alternative name of Pietatella from a painting of the Virgin Mary (La Pietà), spotted there by an unjustly arrested prisoner, as reported in the book Napoli Sacra by Cesare d'Engenio Caracciolo in 1623. When the chapel was constructed it was originally dedicated to Santa Maria della Pietà, after the painting.&nbsp;</p>
